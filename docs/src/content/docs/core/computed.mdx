title: Computed Values
description: Pure data transformations.
---

Computed values (`compute`) are for **derivations**. Use them when you want to transform data without the semantic overhead of "success" or "failure" that Guards provide.

## Usage

Computes take a name, a list of dependencies, and a transform function.

```ts
import { source, compute } from '@pulse-js/core';

const firstName = source('Alice');
const lastName = source('Smith');

const fullName = compute('full-name', [firstName, lastName], (first, last) => {
  return `${first} ${last}`; // "Alice Smith"
});
```

## Characteristics

- **Memoized**: They only re-calculate when inputs change.
- **Pure**: They should not have side effects.
- **Observable**: You can subscribe to them or use them in Guards.

## When to use Compute vs Guard?

| Feature | Compute (`compute`) | Guard (`guard`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Data Transformation | Business Logic / Validation |
| **Return Type** | Any Value | Boolean/Promise (mostly) |
| **Has Status?** | No | Yes (`ok`, `fail`, `pending`) |
| **Has Reason?** | No | Yes |
