title: Pulse Objects
description: deep reactive proxies with pulse().
---

The `pulse()` function is the modern way to create reactive state in Pulse.js. It returns a deep reactive Proxy that allows you to work with plain JavaScript objects and arrays while maintaining fine-grained reactivity.

## Creating a Pulse Object

Unlike `source()`, which wraps primitives, `pulse()` is designed for objects and complex state.

```typescript
import { pulse } from '@pulse-js/core';

const state = pulse({
  count: 0,
  user: {
    name: 'Alice',
    settings: {
      theme: 'dark'
    }
  }
});
```

## Direct Mutation

You can mutate any property at any depth directly. Pulse will automatically track which properties are accessed and notify relevant dependents.

```typescript
state.count += 1;
state.user.name = 'Bob';
state.user.settings.theme = 'light';
```

## Adding Methods

Pulse objects can also contain methods. When a method is called, Pulse binds it to the latest reactive proxy, allowing the method to mutate state reactively.

```typescript
const counter = pulse({
  value: 0,
  increment() {
    this.value++; // 'this' refers to the reactive proxy
  }
});

counter.increment();
```

## Deep Reactivity

Pulse v3 implements "lazy deep reactivity". Nested objects are only wrapped in a proxy when they are accessed. This ensures high performance even with very large state trees.

```typescript
const nested = state.user.settings; // This is now a reactive proxy
nested.theme = 'dark'; // Triggers updates correctly
```

## API Reference

### `pulse(initialValue, options?)`

- `initialValue`: The object or array to make reactive.
- `options.name`: (Optional) A unique name for the unit, enabling HMR stability and DevTools tracking.
- `options.deep`: (Default: `true`) Whether to enable deep reactivity.

### Special Properties

- `$raw`: Access the underlying non-proxied object.
- `$subscribe(listener)`: Subscribe to changes on any property within the object.
- `$snapshot()`: Get a shallow copy of the current state.

```typescript
console.log(state.$raw); // { count: 1, ... }
state.$subscribe(() => console.log('State changed!'));
```
