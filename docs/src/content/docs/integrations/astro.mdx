description: Using Pulse.js in Astro components.
---

Pulse.js v2 natively supports Astro. You can use Pulse state to power your Astro pages, with full support for SSR and hydration.

## Installation

Add the Pulse integration to your Astro project:

```bash
npx astro add @pulse-js/astro
```

## Usage

### 1. Configuration

Add the integration to your `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import { pulse } from '@pulse-js/astro/integration';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [pulse()],
});
```

### 2. State Management

Pulse state can be shared across Astro components and other framework islands (React, Vue, Svelte).

```ts
// src/store.ts
import { pulse } from '@pulse-js/core';

export const ui = pulse({
  theme: 'dark',
  sidebarOpen: false
});
```

### 3. In Astro Components

Use Pulse state directly in your `.astro` files.

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import { ui } from '../store';

// Access state on the server
const theme = ui.theme;
---

<html>
  <body class={theme}>
    <h1>Hello Pulse + Astro</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## SSR & Hydration

Pulse state accessed in the frontmatter of an Astro component is evaluated during SSR. If you also use Pulse in a client-side island, the state will automatically hydrate.

> [!TIP]
> Pulse's Proxy-based reactivity makes it ideal for Astro because it doesn't require complex providers or context wrappers.
