# Universal Reactivity & DevTools 2.0

**Release Date:** February 8, 2026

v0.3.0 is the most significant update to Pulse.js since its inception. We've completely rebuilt the core engine to support **Universal Proxy Reactivity**, implemented a **HMR-Stable Registry**, and launched a brand new **Agent-Client DevTools** architecture.

---

## Major Features

### Proxy-Based Reactivity (`pulse()`)

Pulse v3 moves away from explicit `.set()` and `.get()` calls for objects. The new `pulse()` function creates a deep reactive proxy that tracks property access automatically.

```typescript
import { pulse } from "@pulse-js/core";

// Create a reactive object
const state = pulse({
  count: 0,
  user: { name: "Alice" },
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  },
});

// Mutate directly - it's reactive!
state.count++;
state.user.name = "Bob";
```

- **Deep Guard Inspection**: See full dependency trees, execution status, and detailed failure reasons directly in the UI.

### Normalized `GuardReason`

Evaluation failures now **guarantee** a structured `GuardReason` object. Simple strings or thrown errors are automatically wrapped, ensuring you can always safely access `.code` and `.message` in your UI.

```typescript
const { reason } = usePulse(myGuard);
console.log(reason.code); // Always available
console.log(reason.message); // Always available
```

---

## New Integrations

### Astro Integration (`@pulse-js/astro`)

Pulse now native-supports Astro. Use Pulse state on the server during SSR and have it seamlessly hydrate on the client.

### TanStack Query Bridge (`@pulse-js/tanstack`)

Easily bridge asynchronous remote state from TanStack Query into Pulse's reactive ecosystem using the new `guardFromQuery` selector.
