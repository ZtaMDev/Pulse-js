# Advanced Guard Features

**Release Date:** January 19, 2026

This release introduces powerful new guard composition utilities and enhanced debugging for complex dependency trees.

---

## New Features

### `guard.map()` Composition Helper

A new way to transform sources directly into guards with full semantic tracking. This replaces the legacy `compute` for most use cases.

```typescript
const todos = source([{ done: false }, { done: true }]);

// Reactive guard derived from source
const doneCount = guard.map(todos, (list) => list.filter((t) => t.done).length);

// doneCount works as a full Guard<number>
console.log(doneCount.state()); // { status: "ok", value: 1 }
```

### `InferGuardType<T>` Type Helper

Extracting types from guards is now seamless with the new `InferGuardType` utility. Perfect for creating robust TypeScript interfaces.

```typescript
import { guard, type InferGuardType } from "@pulse-js/core";

const authGuard = guard("auth", async () => fetchUser());
type AuthUser = InferGuardType<typeof authGuard>; // User | undefined
```

### Enhanced Guard Debugging

The `.explain()` tree now includes the specific failure reasons for every sub-dependency, eliminating the guesswork in complex guard chains.

```json
/* New explain() output for a failed guard: */
{
  "name": "can-place-order",
  "status": "fail",
  "reason": "Insufficient balance",
  "dependencies": [
    { "name": "has-items", "status": "ok" },
    {
      "name": "sufficient-balance",
      "status": "fail",
      "reason": "Balance is too low"
    }
  ]
}
```
