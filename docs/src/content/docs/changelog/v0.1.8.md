This release significantly improves React ergonomics and fixes critical bugs in the cyclic dependency detection logic.

### Core Improvements (@pulse-js/core 0.1.8)

- **Fixed Cyclic Dependency Detection**: The detection logic has been completely overhauled. It now correctly identifies true cycles (A -> A) without false positives for nested guard compositions (e.g., `guard.all` reading children).
- **`GuardReason` Interface**: The `GuardReason` interface now includes a `toString()` signature. This ensures that reason objects can be safely converted to strings in all environments.

### React Integration (@pulse-js/react 0.1.5)

- **`formatReason` Helper**: A new utility function to easily render guard failure reasons in JSX.
  ```tsx
  import { formatReason } from "@pulse-js/react";
  // ...
  <p>{formatReason(reason)}</p>;
  ```
- **Improved Types**: Internal improvements to how types are exported to prevent circular dependencies during builds.

### DevTools 2.0 (@pulse-js/tools 0.1.5)

- **Tabbed Interface**: New split view with "Inspector" (list) and "Pulse Tree" (dependency graph).
- **Pulse Tree Visualization**: Recursive tree view showing the entire dependency graph of your guards.
  - Expand/Collapse nodes to trace logic flows.
  - View status and failure reasons at every level of the tree.
- **Editable Sources**: Click on any Source value in the inspector to edit it directly. Supports JSON syntax for objects/arrays.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved "Pill" design, better colors, and drag-and-drop mechanics.
