We are excited to announce the first public release of **Pulse**, a semantic reactivity system for modern applications. This release establishes the core primitives and ecosystem under the new `@pulse-js` namespace.

### Packages

- **`@pulse-js/core`**: The reactivity engine.
- **`@pulse-js/react`**: React 18+ integration hooks.
- **`@pulse-js/tools`**: Visual debugging suite (formerly devtools).

### Features

#### Core Reactivity

- **Sources**: Primitive containers for state values.
- **Guards**: First-class "Conditions" that track status (`ok`, `fail`, `pending`) and failure reasons.
- **Composition**: Logic helpers `guard.all`, `guard.any`, `guard.not`, and `guard.compute`.
- **Async Support**: Native Promise handling for async guards.
- **SSR**: Isomorphic `evaluate` (server) and `hydrate` (client) methods.

#### React Integration

- **`usePulse` Hook**: Universal hook for both Sources and Guards.
- **Concurrent Mode**: Built on `useSyncExternalStore` for safe concurrent updates.
- **Smart Re-renders**: Components only update when semantic state changes.

#### Developer Experience

- **Pulse Tools**: A zero-config, draggable overlay for inspecting the reactive graph.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with inferred types.

### Getting Started

```bash
npm install @pulse-js/core @pulse-js/react @pulse-js/tools
```
