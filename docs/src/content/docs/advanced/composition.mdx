description: Declarative ways to combine guards.

Pulse encourages building small, atomic logic units and composing them into larger rules. This keeps your business logic testable and readable.

## `guard.all(name, [guards])`

Passes only if **ALL** provided guards have a status of `ok`.
If any guard fails, the composed guard fails with the reason of the *first* failing dependency.

```ts
const canLaunch = guard.all('can-launch', [
  isSystemReady,
  isFuelFull,
  isClearWeather
]);
```

## `guard.any(name, [guards])`

Passes if **AT LEAST ONE** guard has a status of `ok`.

```ts
const hasAccess = guard.any('access-allowed', [
  isAdmin,
  isOwner,
  hasGuestPass
]);
```

## `guard.not(name, guard)`

Inverts the status of the target guard.
- If target is `ok` -> `guard.not` is `fail`.
- If target is `fail` -> `guard.not` is `ok`.

```ts
const isLocked = guard.not('is-locked', isOpen);
```

## Nesting

Because these composed units are just standard Guards, you can nest them infinitely.

```ts
const canDelete = guard.all('can-delete', [
   isAuthenticated,
   guard.any('permission', [isAdmin, isOwner])
]);
```
